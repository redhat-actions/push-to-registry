**image-url**: Contains complete URL of the image which is pushed using this action. (e.g. `quay.io/username/spring-image:v1`)

## Examples

The example below shows how the `push-to-registry` action can be used to push an image created by the [`buildah-action`](https://github.com/redhat-actions/buildah-action) in an early step.

```yaml
name: Build and Push Image
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      IMAGE_NAME: petclinic
      BUILT_JAR: "target/spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar"

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - run: mvn package

    - name: Build Image
      uses: redhat-actions/buildah-action@0.0.1
      with:
        new-image-name: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
        content: |
          ${{ env.BUILT_JAR }}
        entrypoint: |
          java
          -jar
          ${{ env.BUILT_JAR }}
        port: 8080
    - name: Push To Quay
      uses: redhat-actions/push-to-registry@v1
      with:
        image: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
        registry: ${{ secrets.QUAY_REPO }}
        username: ${{ secrets.QUAY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.QUAY_TOKEN }}
```
